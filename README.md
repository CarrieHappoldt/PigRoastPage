# PigRoastPage

A simple Angular4 web app, for our families annual Pig Roast

##### Start using the app at localhost:8080     

### Techniques Used
This app was created to hone my skills at: 

 * Angular 4
 * TypeScript
 * Bootstrap
 * HTML/CSS
 
### Techniques Learned
During this project I learned to use:

 * Angular Databinding
 * Angular Form Validation
 * Angular Components and Models
 * Angular Decorators and Directives
 * Typescript Classes and Data Types
 * Bootstraps carousel slideshow
 * git
 
I have enjoyed learning Angular 4 and Typescript. I find that Angular 4 makes a fast and responsive UI. It was easy enough to learn but I know I could get a deeper understanding.  I liked that Typescript helped to resolves the type coercion errors that can be found in javascript. And I really liked the use of typescript classes and constructor functions, instead of the javascripts prototypes. 

### How to Run
 1. Clone the repository
 2. `npm install`
 3. `ng server --port: 8080`
 4. `open http://localhost:8080`

### To Do
I don't think any project is every *really* finished. So here is what I still want to improve:

  * Add MySQL or MongoDB
  * Add an edit and delete function
  * improve the name requirements - check to see if they'd already signed up
 
##### Note
This is my second github repository (yeah!) and will not be my last! I have many other projects in the works, just not cleaned up enough to show off.

Thanks for visiting!
